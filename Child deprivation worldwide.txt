# Analysis of Child Deprivation Worldwide
Child deprivation is a global issue that affects millions of children around the world. It refers to the denial of access to basic needs such as food, water, shelter, education, and healthcare, among others. According to UNICEF, children living in poverty are more likely to experience deprivation than those from wealthier households. In this report, we will use data from UNICEF to explore the state of child deprivation worldwide.
